# "Something is wrong on the Internet" by James Bridle

James Bridle argues that the internet has a large amount of inappropriate content for kids -targeted to them. He believes "someone or something[...] is using YouTube to systematically frighten, traumatize, and abuse children," and that this happens because of the lack of monitoring, thus making this an unsafe environment for them. It becomes insignificant whether this is the product of human mistake or evil purposeful design. The system fails to protect kids, regardless of the intentionality behind it. 

Bridle's solution to this problem is explained clearly in his text: the internet should be a trusted, known, and reliable place for everyone. He emphasizes taking down the videos that could traumatize a kid, which is a helpful first step followed by monitoring content. However, the consequences could mean validating overall control of the use of the internet, including censorships and privacy loss. When it comes to adapting society to this new era, it is necessary to understand it is for the greater good, which now is kids. It is crucial to find the balance between safety and freedom for our society to evolve.
