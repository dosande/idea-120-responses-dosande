## Healthcare System as a WMD

Based on what O'Neil describes as a Weapon of Math Destruction, the current
Healthcare system -and their softwares- can be a WMD. Many models used in this
area, like insurance, have a clear idea in mind when looking for new people to
consume their services. The first issue is that their subject does not know the
totality of their expectations or requisites; people seeking health insurance
are kept in the dark.

 Some of the insurance company's interest is money; they are not succeeding if
 they are not making money out of people. This means that, in a majority of
 cases, people's interest are disregarded. For the most part, this group is
 made up of lower-class people and sick people in need for treatment, medicine,
 or therapy who turn out to be discriminated by the system. It is now when this
 people are unfairly let down by a model that damages the lives of those who
 need their help the most.

 Sadly this model has the capacity to scale, and we have seen it. The start of
 not proving enough coverage when using their services, can quickly become what
 determines whether people seek professional help or not when needed. It can
 mean never visiting the doctor because of its inaccessibility, and end up
 going when it is too late.
