# Images Through a Different Lens

Imagine this. A nice outdoor area, blue skies, all of your friends. You're feeling adventurous, bold -enough to camp at a prohibited zone-. You put your tents up, place your chairs on the grass, start making food before it's too dark. You take a picture of the moment. You post it on your social media and get hundreds of likes. "Oh, how fearless!" comments one. "This looks like so much fun," says another.

<img width="900" alt="image" src="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/unionleader.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/17/b179e22e-f6af-5a83-9c1a-1ece6bff9d96/5f752385782e8.image.jpg?resize=1698%2C1220">

Now let's see what happened. The image is from a journalist reporting the "no camping" signs at homeless encampments. Here the linguistic message can trick even those who understand English. The sign might be directed towards campers, to inform them that this place is not suited for camping. But it is not. It is directed to homeless people, to restrict them from living in this area. 

The connoted symbolic message of this image not only varies depending on culture but also on socioeconomic group. It could look like a fun temporary experience for the higher class interested in the outdoors. Or it could represent the tough reality of many for those aware of the number of homeless people. The denoted literal message focuses on the objects, which can also change depending on our background. Tents signify vacation only if these have never been your home before.
