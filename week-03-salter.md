## *Gesamtkunstwerk*

Described by Richard Wagner as a fusion of the everyday and the extraordinary, where different forms of art meet to create a new type of artwork. Nowadays we would probably call this concept multimedia art, where we use the combination of two or more different medium to put together an expression of art. Some of the contemporary tools we could use in addition to traditional methods are video editing and photography. When putting together something as traditional as painting and animated photography, we are left with a result that can easily classify as multimedia. For example, using our own phone’s camera to take pictures and then print them to write poems on them could be considered Gesamtkunstwerk, since we are capturing everyday stories and then exposing them in an artistic way.

In the Rhizone Anthology, “A Cyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st Century” by VNS Matrix in 1991 could qualify as Gesamtkunstwerk of the time. This project started from a cyberfeminist movement using elements such as poetry and image editing, and spread through the form of everyday paper pamphlets, ads, and posters to take a political stance against the patriarchal society; multimedia art “adopting the techniques of propaganda as an art practice,” (Rhizome Anthology).
